# Project Overview

## Goals
* I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the work and process behind game development
* I aim to create a product that I am proud of.
* I hope to make any beginner mistakes here and learn from them, so as to avoid making them in the future.

## Proposed Work/Timeline
* My proposed timeline is from May 6 through August 13, 2021.
	* The first half of May will be dedicated to planning the code and storyline
	* The rest of May and June will be dedicated to the actual implementation.
	* July will be dedicated to testing the game and writing a user manual
	* August will be dedicated to polishing any last touches.

## Final Product
* The final product will be a playable game, based on interactive environments and creative problem solving.


# Rationale

## Education and Future Goals
* My career goal is to work in back end game development, and I view this as my first step to achieving that goal.
* The skills necessary to finish this project will deepen my education in Computer Science through first hand experience.

## Research Experience/Critical Thinking
* The game will be based on problem solving, and I will have to reverse engineer these problems. This will demand a deep understanding of the problem solving process, and requires critical thinking.
* I am completely green when it comes to game development, so the entire experience will require personal driven research on my part to understand many of the aspects of the craft.

## Broadening Cross-Discipline Experience
* The majority of my experience in Computer Science has been with algorithms and learning languages and problem solving techniques.
* This project will require my attention to all aspects of development, including
	* Algorithms and logic
	* Graphics and appearance; what the consumer will see
	* Story telling and user engagement
	* Usability; how well the implementation translates to actual gameplay

## Community Engagement
* Video games are a global past-time. Learning to create my own connects me to anyone in the world that may play a game I work on in the future.
* Already I have gotten support in the form of advice from classmates that are ahead of me in game development. As I move forward with this project, I will continue to learn from those in the community that have been where I am in experience (or lack thereof).
